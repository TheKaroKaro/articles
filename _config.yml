# Permalinks: Enforce categories in the URL structure

# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX FOR GITHUB PAGES ðŸš¨
# 1. Collections: Define the category pages as a custom collection
collections:
  pages:
    output: true
    permalink: /:path/
  
# 2. Force Jekyll to process folders starting with underscores (if applicable)
# If you kept your category pages in a folder like `_pages` or `categories`
include: ["_config.yml", "categories", "assets", "_posts"]

# Navigation/Category Menu
